import os
This allows the code to use os.system('cls' or 'clear') to clear the terminal screen — useful for updating the game board visually.

🔹 2. Function Definitions
✅ check_turn(turn)
python
Copy
Edit
def check_turn(turn):
    return 'X' if turn % 2 == 0 else 'O'
Decides whose turn it is.

Even turns → Player X

Odd turns → Player O

✅ check_for_win(spots)
python
Copy
Edit
def check_for_win(spots):
    wins = [
        (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9),  # Rows
        (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9),  # Columns
        (1, 5, 9), (3, 5, 7)              # Diagonals
    ]
    for a, b, c in wins:
        if spots[a] == spots[b] == spots[c]:
            return True
    return False
Checks all possible winning combinations.

Returns True if any line has all the same symbol (X or O).

⚠️ Problem: You redefine the same functions inside another function
Inside draw_board(spots), you redefine draw_board, check_turn, and check_for_win. Like this:

python
Copy
Edit
def draw_board(spots):
    print(...)  # Drawing board

    def draw_board(spots):
        ...
    def check_turn(turn):
        ...
    def check_for_win(dict):
        ...
This is not valid or necessary. Those inner definitions will never run, and they confuse the scope. Just delete everything inside the first draw_board() except for the code that draws the board. I'll explain the correct version below.

✅ draw_board(spots)
python
Copy
Edit
def draw_board(spots):
    print(f"\n {spots[1]} | {spots[2]} | {spots[3]}")
    print("---|---|---")
    print(f" {spots[4]} | {spots[5]} | {spots[6]}")
    print("---|---|---")
    print(f" {spots[7]} | {spots[8]} | {spots[9]}\n")
Neatly displays the current state of the board using the spots dictionary.

🔹 3. Game Setup
python
Copy
Edit
spots = {i: str(i) for i in range(1, 10)}
playing, complete = True, False
turn = 0
prev_turn = -1
spots: A dictionary to hold the state of each tile. Starts numbered from 1–9.

playing: Whether the game is still running.

complete: Whether someone has won.

turn: Keeps track of whose turn it is.

prev_turn: Used to detect an invalid move (no change in turn).

🔹 4. Game Loop
python
Copy
Edit
while playing:
This is where the game runs repeatedly until the game ends.

Step-by-step in the loop:
🔁 Clear the screen:
python
Copy
Edit
os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
🎲 Draw the board:
python
Copy
Edit
draw_board(spots)
❗ Show error if no move made (invalid input):
python
Copy
Edit
if prev_turn == turn:
    print("Invalid spot selected, please pick another.")
prev_turn = turn
👤 Prompt the player:
python
Copy
Edit
print(f"Player {(turn % 2) + 1}'s turn: Pick your spot or press 'q' to quit")
choice = input()
❌ Handle quitting:
python
Copy
Edit
if choice.lower() == 'q':
    playing = False
    continue
✅ Handle valid move:
python
Copy
Edit
if choice.isdigit() and int(choice) in spots:
    spot = int(choice)
    if spots[spot] not in {'X', 'O'}:
        spots[spot] = check_turn(turn)
        turn += 1
❌ Handle invalid input:
python
Copy
Edit
else:
    continue
🏁 Check win or tie:
python
Copy
Edit
if check_for_win(spots):
    playing, complete = False, True
elif turn >= 9:
    playing = False
Ends the game if someone wins.

Ends the game if all 9 turns are taken (tie).

🔚 After the Game Loop
Final screen refresh and result:

python
Copy
Edit
os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
draw_board(spots)
🏆 Declare winner or tie:
python
Copy
Edit
if complete:
    winner = 'Player 1' if check_turn(turn - 1) == 'X' else 'Player 2'
    print(f"{winner} Wins!")
else:
    print("No Winner")
🙏 Thank the player:
python
Copy
Edit
print("Thanks for playing!")
✅ Summary of Fixes You Should Make:
Delete the redefined functions inside draw_board — they're unnecessary and might cause scope issues.

Clean up the function definitions to be at the top and not nested.

✅ Want a cleaned-up version?
If you want, I can paste a fixed and clean version of your full game script with everything in the right order and tidy. Just say the word!
