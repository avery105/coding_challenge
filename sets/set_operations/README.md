#Concept:   Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
#Objective:   Combine and compare sets using set operations.
#Task:  
#Create two sets: `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}`.
#Print the union, intersection, and difference.

#Example Output:  
```
#Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
#Intersection: {3, 4}
#Difference: {1, 2}
